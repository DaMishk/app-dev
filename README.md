## Why I Love It 🕷️

- ** This movie made me realize to not doubt myself in times of hardships, this movie became my light when I was in a dark place this movie portrayed a lot of emotions that I could relate into specially when it comes to loving yourself because I had failed to love myself back in those days but now I feel like doing my own thing.
